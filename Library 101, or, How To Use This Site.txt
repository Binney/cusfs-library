Everything in the CUSFS Library is an Item. The Type column corresponds to whether it's a Book, Film, Game, Magazine, or Other. More categories can obviously be added.

The number of films or magazines in the library (~20) is somewhat dwarfed by the number of books in the library (~6000) so the default type is Book.

The status column for Items is for e.g. Available [at least one copy is in the library collection ready to be taken out], All copies taken out, Lost, Damaged, etc

TODO LIST

Users obviously

TakeOut as a model (needs a snappier name though). Each book has a column for how many copies the library has of them. A TakeOut has a UserId, ItemId, CheckoutDate, and (most importantly) ItemVersion so e.g. A by default but if there's multiple copies you might get B (a hardback) instead of A (a paperback).

Add genre info to books (by default there's no genre, and this can be done whenever people want to procrastinate). Then get art for each genre so you can browse by type (eg steampunk, space opera, whatever - like the tags on Link Up)

Add review options

Add a "Official Recommendations List" option with according links to the books and highlights which of CUSFS' Top 100 aren't in the library (so they can be bought....?)

Comments section at the bottom of each book?

Request specific books and send an email to the Librarian/add it to a public list of requested books for others to +1 ?

Capacity to upload, parse, and add a correctly formatted CSV of books? http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-file-uploading.htm

Use https://github.com/visionmedia/google-search to google book to retrieve cover and blurb?

Item show page: What you want here is a collapsible pane of boring stuff like ISBN, date published, where in the collection it is, etc. The information visible by default is the obvious stuff, plus genre tags, and comments. Ideally you want to be able to spider Google Images for a picture of the cover as an image, or maybe Amazon, but that might not be possible.
