Everything in the CUSFS Library is an Item. The Type column corresponds to whether it's a Book, Film, Game, Magazine, or Other. More categories can obviously be hard coded in if need be.

The number of films or magazines in the library (~20) is somewhat dwarfed by the number of books in the library (~6000) so the default type is Book.

The status column for Items is for e.g. Available [at least one copy is in the library collection ready to be taken out], All copies taken out, Lost, Damaged, etc

The Librarian's account works like this. There is ONE librarian account; it's the first account in the list. This is because the Librarian is sovereign. There are also accounts for the Chairbeing, the Secretary, and the other committee members. These are *hard coded into the site*. Each time the committee changes, these accounts are passed on to the next bearer of that position. Committee positions have admin privileges.

Each committee member ALSO has their own personal account which is theirs alone and which they keep after their tenure is up. The idea is that committee members check books out with their personal account, not their committee one; the latter is only used for admin-y purposes, like moderation and editing library entries.

It'd nice if all accounts had a Title, too, as a gimmick. As in, Chairbeing's is "Almighty", Reeve is "Omnipotent", and if you're some random user you can make something up, like in the Jomsbook. (Though they're moderated to a certain extent.)

The string Editions column in Items is a bit weird but here goes. Some items have multiple editions, eg we have 3 copies of The State Of The Art by Iain M Banks; their codes are BANK2/1-4 followed by b,c,d respectively. How do we tell how many copies of the same Item are in the library, which codes they each have, and which one has just been withdrawn? Answer: The Item entry for The State Of The Art has an Editions entry which is "bcd". This means you can count the number of characters in the string to tell you how many copies are in the library; you can look inside the string to ask which of the three has been withdrawn (even if they don't go alphabetically; in the Banks example "a" has clearly been lost at some point). And if we want to add a new one or remove one, we can just delete that character of the string and it doesn't affect withdrawals of the other copies.

TODO LIST

The styling for flashes doesn't go with the theme; redo colours? certainly the green :success looks horrible

Would be nice to get the Withdraw and Return buttons working via Ajax. Need to refresh the entire _availability partial though.

BUG: If you're importing a CSV the bit which detects the series is flawed. It just seizes the last character for the number and all but the last two characters for the name. This means it doesn't work if the book you're importing is more than 10th in the series (dammit, Robert Jordan) because by extracting only the last digit it wil think the series title is "Wheel of Time " rather than "Wheel of Time" and create a new series. Solution: in the short term, get Ruby to knock off all trailing whitespace from the name to get series name right, and use the bookcode column to get number rather than string. But in this just passes the buck to series with more than 99 books in (which I'm sure exist somewhere...) so in the long run should use regex to check intelligently.

Authors model, for easier view and index stuff?

How should it deal with 2in1 books, like Shadow and Betrayal by Daniel Abraham?!

Gems for searching. Obviously use Ransack for the book search, but there's also Sphinx which appears to let you do searches of everything. So, that's nice. Means we can search Schedule and TTBAs and so on. Investigate!

Add genre info to books (by default there's no genre, and this can be done whenever people want to procrastinate). Then get art for each genre so you can browse by type (eg steampunk, space opera, whatever - like the tags on Link Up)

Add review options with stars and things

Comments section at the bottom of each book? ^ Possibly same as reviews of books but you don't need to star it

Request specific books and send an email to the Librarian/add it to a public list of requested books for others to +1 ?

Add a "Official Recommendations List" option with according links to the books and highlights which of CUSFS' Top 100 aren't in the library (so they can be bought....?)

RECOMMENDATIONS LISTS
Would be nice if there was a pretty flexible system for variable-length lists of books which can be created, destroyed, and edited frequently. There are obviously official ones like "Top 10 Space Operas" which are managed by the Librarian, but also individual users can create their own lists like "My Favourite Stories Involving Dragons".

To do this, you need a Collection model. So;

class User
	has_many :collections
end

class Collection
	belongs_to :user
	has_many :items, through: :exhibits
end

class Exhibit
	belongs_to :collection
	belongs_to :item
end

class Item
	has_many :collections, through: :exhibits
end

Capacity to upload, parse, and add a correctly formatted CSV of books? http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-file-uploading.htm

Item show page: What you want here is a collapsible pane of boring stuff like ISBN, date published, where in the collection it is, etc. The information visible by default is the obvious stuff, plus genre tags, and comments. Ideally you want to be able to spider Google Images for a picture of the cover as an image, or maybe Amazon, but that might not be possible.

^ Use https://github.com/visionmedia/google-search to google book to retrieve cover? And spider Goodreads.com for the blurb?
